# Predicting Heart Failure

In order to predict heart failure, we use a [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) that contains several features relevant to cardiovascular diseases. We look for the most relevant features and parameters, and build a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier accordingly.
